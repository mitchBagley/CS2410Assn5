# CS2410Assn5

This Software Devolopment Plan is taken from Erik Falor's CS1440 homework assingment. 

## Phase 0: Requirements Analysis (tag name `analyzed`)
*(20% of your effort)*

**Important - do not change the code in this phase**

Deliver:

*  I am making a program that shows off various components of html and the source code inside. As well, each individual component will have 
   their own animations to it (except for navbar).
*  A good solution allows the user to interact with the components and see the html and css code attached to it.
*  A bad solution doesn't allow the user to interact with the website and is not visually appealing. The layout doesn't make sense.
*  The components will be centered on the screen which is where the user should interact with the majority of the page. The sides should not 
   have to be used as much. This will be achieved through html classes and the flex feature on CSS.
    
*  JS Algorithms:
     * For loops
     * The Spread operator
     * if statements
     * Built in javascript methods 
*  HTML Algorithms:
     * classes
     * navbar
     * navigation drawer
     * button
     * floating action button
     * image carousel
     * loading spinner (3 different ones)
     * divs
     * the pre class (will have to study)
     * add the other files at the beginning
* CSS Algorithms: 
     * flexbox
     * color
     * background color
     * width
     * height
     * margin

## Phase 1: Design (tag name `designed`)
*(30% of your effort)*

**Important - do not change the code in this phase**

Deliver:

* Design ideas
    * Have everything in the center so that it can be easier for the user to see everything
    * components- go in order from the assignment requirements 
        * navbar
        * navigation drawer
        * button
        * floating action button
        * image carousel
        * loading spinners
    * I should organize everything by boxes, which I've used previously
    * Possible idea: having a drop down button that displays all of the component options. When the option is clicked then all of the needed information for the component is listed.


Don't have enough time to complete the rest of the SDP but here are some final thoughts.

* This was a good project. I learned a lot about animation and the key frame in css is a life saver. I love that thing. The pre tag in html is a good tool to use. I could make this project more organized. The thought of making more files based on the components is a great idea that I should have utitlized. Maybe, if I come back to this down the road, is something that I'll do.
