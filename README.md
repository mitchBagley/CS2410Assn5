# CS2410Assn5

This Software Devolopment Plan is taken from Erik Falor's CS1440 homework assingment. 

## Phase 0: Requirements Analysis (tag name `analyzed`)
*(20% of your effort)*

**Important - do not change the code in this phase**

Deliver:

*  I am making a program that shows off various components of html and the source code inside. As well, each individual component will have 
   their own animations to it (except for navbar).
*  A good solution allows the user to interact with the components and see the html and css code attached to it.
*  A bad solution doesn't allow the user to interact with the website and is not visually appealing. The layout doesn't make sense.
*  The components will be centered on the screen which is where the user should interact with the majority of the page. The sides should not 
   have to be used as much. This will be achieved through html classes and the flex feature on CSS.
    
*  JS Algorithms:
     * For loops
     * The Spread operator
     * if statements
     * Built in javascript methods 
*  HTML Algorithms:
     * classes
     * navbar
     * navigation drawer
     * button
     * floating action button
     * image carousel
     * loading spinner (3 different ones)
     * divs
     * the pre class (will have to study)
* CSS Algorithms: 
     * flexbox
     * color
     * background color
     * width
     * height
     * margin

## Phase 1: Design (tag name `designed`)
*(30% of your effort)*

**Important - do not change the code in this phase**

Deliver:

*   [ ] Function signatures that include:
    *   Descriptive names.
    *   Parameter lists.
    *   Documentation strings that explain its purpose and types of inputs and outputs.
*   [ ] Pseudocode that captures how each function works.
    *   Pseudocode != source code.  Do not paste your finished source code into this part of the plan.
*   Explain what happens in the face of good and bad input.
    *   Write a few specific examples that occur to you, and use them later when testing
*   [ ] Tag the last commit in this phase `designed`
    *   *Grace Points: if this tag is pushed by midnight on the Sunday before the due date, you will receive up to 5 points back*


## Phase 2: Implementation (tag name `implemented`)
*(15% of your effort)*

**Finally, you can write code!**

Deliver:

*   [ ] More or less working code.
*   [ ] Note any relevant and interesting events that happened while you wrote the code.
    *   e.g. things you learned, things that didn't go according to plan
*   [ ] Tag the last commit in this phase `implemented`


## Phase 3: Testing and Debugging (tag name `tested`)
*(30% of your effort)*

Deliver:

*   [ ] A set of test cases that you have personally run on your computer.
    *   Include a description of what happened for each test case.
    *   For any bugs discovered, describe their cause and remedy.
    *   Write your test cases in plain language such that a non-coder could run them and replicate your experience.
*   [ ] Tag the last commit in this phase `tested`


## Phase 4: Deployment (tag name `deployed`)
*(5% of your effort)*

Deliver:

*   [ ] Tag the last commit in this phase `deployed`
*   [ ] Your repository is pushed to GitLab.
*   [ ] **Verify** that your final commit was received by browsing to its project page on GitLab.
    *   Ensure the project's URL is correct.
    *   Review the project to ensure that all required files are present and in correct locations.
    *   Check that unwanted files have not been included.
    *   Make any final touches to documentation, including the Sprint Signature and this Plan.
*   [ ] **Validate** that your submission is complete and correct by cloning it to a new location on your computer and re-running it.
	*	Run your program from the command line so you can see how it will behave when your grader runs it.  **Running it in PyCharm is not good enough!**
    *   Run through your test cases to avoid nasty surprises.
    *   Check that your documentation files are all present.


## Phase 5: Maintenance

Spend a few minutes writing thoughtful answers to these questions.  They are meant to make you think about the long-term consequences of choices you made in this project.

Deliver:

*   [ ] Write brief and honest answers to these questions:
    *   What parts of your program are sloppily written and hard to understand?
        *   Are there parts of your program which you aren't quite sure how/why they work?
        *   If a bug is reported in a few months, how long would it take you to find the cause?
    *   Will your documentation make sense to...
        *   ...anybody besides yourself?
        *   ...yourself in six month's time?
    *   How easy will it be to add a new feature to this program in a year?
    *   Will your program continue to work after upgrading...
        *   ...your computer's hardware?
        *   ...the operating system?
        *   ...to the next version of Python?
*   [ ] Make one final commit and push your **completed** Software Development Plan to GitLab.
*   [ ] Respond to the **Assignment Reflection Survey** on Canvas.
